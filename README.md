## My process

For this challenge I went with a mobile-first workflow.  As I increased the screen size I created a new media query and tweaked the css until I received the desired output.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Completing this challenge I learned how to use the mobile-first workflow.  For me it tends to be easier to do desktop first, but I then find it a pain to have to go back and change everything to scale it down to mobile.  Coding for mobile first I found is actually much easier as its easier to scale up then to scale down.  I also learned more about using media queries and make the breakpoints smoother so that the transitions from different screen sizes arent so drastic.  The directions werent as clear but I took it a step further and made extra media queries for ipad portrait and landscape, laptop screens and desktop screens.

### Continued development

I will continue to work on using the mobile-first workflow as well as mastering CSS Flexbox.  Im sure I probably could have completed this in less lines of code, but im still working on this process!
